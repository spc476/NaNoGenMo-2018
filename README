                  The Valley Girl of Oz, Bjork Bjork Bjork

                          "Written" by Sean Conner.
                     Based upon _The Emerald City of Oz_
                              by L. Frank Baum.

  This is my 2018 entry for NaNoGenMo [1].  After many false attempts to
come up with a decent idea, I finally settled for this---take one of L.
Frank Baum's Oz books (the first one to exceed 50,000 words---for the
record, it's the 6th book in the series) and run it through a translator.
In this case, the translator doesn't convert the work into Kyrgyz and back
into English, but into Valleyspeak (you know, like, what Valley Girls, like,
speak?  Gag me with a spoon!).

  But I wanted to have some challenge to this, so I decided to convert the
text of the book into Valleyspeak, but the actual dialog in the book into
Swedish Chef (sorry Sweden!).  Trust me, it was less offensive than my first
choice, Jive.

  I converted the origial Valleyspeak and Swedish Chef translators to Lua,
as it would make it easier to combine the two using LPeg (which is one of
the strengths of LPeg---it's parsing expressions that can be combined) than
attempting to get it working with the original lex based code.

  The file 'chef.lua' is the standalone Swedish Chef translator, and
'valley.lua' is the standalone Valleyspeak translator, and 'run.lua'
combines the two into something that actually works.  Some testing reveals
that LPeg 1.0 will crash; until it's fixed, use of LPeg 0.12 is encouraged
for this code.

  Included are the original sources I have for the Valleyspeak and Swedish
Chef translators.
